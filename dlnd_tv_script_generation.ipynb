Out of curiosity I wanted to see if the loss would increase without the dropout, but in this case the loss went down. I don't quite understand why, but I stuck to it. \n",

At first I started with a learning rate of 0.01, but saw that this was causing some weird patterns in the early stages of training so I decreased it down to 0.001. With a learning rate of 0.001 there was a drastic improvement, but I was not able to reach the desired loss of 3.5. I decreased the embedding_dim from 300 to 200 but saw no drastic improvement. As for sequence_length I largened the size from 15 to 20 and saw an improvement. At first I chose 15 as I saw that the scripts were rather short (most times being less than 15 words), but I wanted to see if there was a difference with a sequence_length of 20 to which I saw a reasonable improvement in the loss. Ultimately I think I was just training for too short, 5 epochs, therefore I increased the epochs from 5 to 10 and now the loss is below 3.5.\n",
