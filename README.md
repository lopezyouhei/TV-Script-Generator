# TV-Script-Generator
The repository uses a type of RNN (LSTM) to learn from a script of Seinfeld and then generate an unseen script of the TV show Seinfeld. This is a project from the Udacity Nanodegree course Deep Learning.


# Note
There's a file which I have not included called "trained_rnn.pt" which would have the trained information of the LSTM RNN because the file is too large to upload. If you are able to train the model on your own, the notebook will automatically generate this file after training.
