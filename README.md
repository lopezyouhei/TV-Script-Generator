# About the Project
The project is one of the milestone projects offered in Udacity's nanodegree Deep Learning program. The goal of the project is to generate unseen scripts of the TV show Seinfeld. This is done by training an LSTM RNN model with scripts from the Seinfeld TV show. 

# Note
There's a file which I have not included called "trained_rnn.pt" which would have the trained information of the LSTM RNN because the file is too large to upload. If you are able to train the model on your own, the notebook will automatically generate this file after training.
